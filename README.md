# Graphics Mill Samples

Graphics Mill is an advanced image processing library. Here is a brief features highlight:

* Loads/saves JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, EPS, PDF, EPS, PSD and other image formats.
* Pixels can be RGB, CMYK, Lab, grayscale, 8 and 16-bit per channel.
* Manipulate metadata such as EXIF, IPTC, XMP, Adobe Resources (including clipping path).
* Popular operations on images including crop, resize, rotate and many others.
* Other bitmap manipulation algorithms, filters, color/tone/brightness/contrasts adjustments.
* Draw bitmap and vector elements.
* Powerful text output features - single and multiline text, artistic effects, text line distortions.
* Convert colors with ICC profiles.

Graphics Mill Web Controls is a front end for Graphics Mill library. It includes:
